        " 1. what is python and why is it popular?\n",
        "   - pyhton is a programming language used widely and efficiently. its popular because its simple, has many library, its object oriented.\n",
        " 2. what is an interpreter in python?\n",
        "   - an interpreter is computer program that converts a programming language into a machine level code\n",
        " 3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "   - pre-defined keywords are the keywordes that have special meaning in the programing language and cannot be used as identifiers. example-True,False,import etc\n",
        " 4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "   - no, keywords are reserved words and cannot be used as variable names.\n",
        " 5. What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "   - mutability is the ability to change or alter the object without creating a new object.\n",
        " 6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "   - because the contents of list can be changed and the contents of tuple cannot be changed thus list is mutable and tuple is immutable.\n",
        " 7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n",
        "   - The == operator checks for equality of values which means it evaluates whether the values of two objects are the same. On the other hand, is operator checks for identity, meaning it determines whether two variables point to the same object in memory.\n",
        "8. What are logical operators in Python?\n",
        "  - Logical operators in Python are used to combine conditional statements. The three main logical operators are:\n",
        "     and: Returns True if both statements are true.\n",
        "     or: Returns True if at least one of the statements is true.\n",
        "     not: Reverses the result, returns False if the result is true\n",
        "  9. What is type casting in Python?\n",
        "     - Type casting in Python, also known as type conversion, is the process of converting one data type to another.\n",
        "  10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "     - In implicit type casting, the programming language automatically converts data from one type to another if needed. For example, if you have an integer variable and you try to assign it to a float variable, the programming language will automatically convert the integer to a float without you having to do anything.\n",
        "     Explicit type casting, also known as type conversion or type coercion, occurs when the programmer explicitly converts a value from one data type to another. Unlike implicit type casting, explicit type casting requires the programmer to specify the desired data type conversion.\n",
        "  11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        "    - Conditional statements, also known as control flow statements, allow your program to make decisions based on certain conditions. These statements evaluate an expression for a Boolean value (True or False) and execute a block of code accordingly. The main types of conditional statements in Python are: if statements.\n",
        " 12. How does the elif statement work?\n",
        "    - An \"elif\" statement in Python stands for \"else if\" and is used to check for additional conditions sequentially after an initial \"if\" statement, meaning if the first condition is false, it moves on to evaluate the next \"elif\" condition until one is found to be true; essentially allowing you to check multiple conditions in a chain before potentially reaching an \"else\" statement if none of the previous conditions are met.\n",
        "  13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
        "     - For loop\n",
        "        Used when you know the number of iterations in advance. A for loop is best for repeating a block of code for each item in a list or sequence. For example, you can use a for loop to print out all the elements of a vector.\n",
        "      While loop\n",
        "        Used when you don't know the number of iterations in advance. A while loop is best for repeating a block of code until a condition is met. For example, you can use a while loop to ask a user for a number between 1 and 10\n",
        "    14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop?\n",
        "      - User Input Validation: If you're asking a user to input a number between 1 and 10, and you want to keep prompting them until they provide a valid input, a while loop is ideal. You would check if the input is within the desired range within the loop condition, and only exit the loop when the user provides valid input.\n",
